  "description": "When writing a Script, it is important to understand how the Script will be executed under a specific CKB-VM version. The CKB network has introduced various CKB-VM versions over time to enhance security, performance, bug fixes and support for new RISC-V extensions. However, the upgrade should not break the old code, and users must have the opt-in option to specify the VM version.",
